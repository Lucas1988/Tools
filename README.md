This tool can be used to easily debug your Python code.
When an error occurs in your code, it will automatically search for the error on StackOverflow, and return the top rated answer from the highest ranking matching question. To achieve this, it makes use of the Stack Exchange API.
Since I admittedly google for error codes on a daily basis pretty often, and usually end up on StackOverflow anyway, this is a big time saver for me.

Just replace the indented code in the 'try' with your code. This can be any code! The example I put right there is pretty silly, but is just to demonstrate how it works. It won't work for syntax errors, but those are usually so clearly explained by the Python debugger, that you won't need this anyway.
